# Tiny Scripts

This is a collection of scripts I rely on alot. Most started as one-liners and grew from there. Many are exported from my `.aliases` file and you can see how to make them a one-liner again and alias them yourself. I have tried to add `#/bin/shell` and `*.sh` to everything that needs it.
